My name is Ahmed, I’m 20 years old .I’m a student from Alexandria ,Egypt and I want to get into Computer Science field .I don't have a  job my father pays my college fees but it would be very hard if he pays the fees of the course as i live in Egypt ,a growing up country ,and the dollar/pound ratio is badly high making everything extremely expensive here .In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid .I want to take this course as I want to to be Software Developer and it will surely help me a lot in my career path. Also it will increase my knowledge in this field,which would help me to have better opportunities in the future.
Thanks ,Ahmed Hazem.

I want to complete this course and commit to it till the end. It will enhance my  knowledge and i will learn useful applicable science that I love. It will also help me to perform better in this field and have better opportunities in the future. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.Programming is my passion and I will take pride in teaching all my friends or any one who can’t afford taking these courses and don’t have stable internet connection -like most of the my mates here in Egypt – for free.I plan to complete all assignments on or before time. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
Thanks ,Ahmed Hazem.
